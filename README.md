JavaScript code is always such a mess! This program takes your program and organises it into neat little columns. I've even done this with this very program, so take a peek in [index.js](./index.js).

In order to use this program, you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) first.

This program was inspired by [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ioufuf/when_someone_asks_you_to_write_clear_commented/g4g2dxt) on Reddit. Thanks, u/Pfuenzle and u/Per-mille!

The code is available under an MIT license. Have fun!

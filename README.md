JavaScript code is always such a mess! This program takes your program and organises it into neat little columns. I've even done this with this very program, so take a peek in [index.js](./index.js).

In order to use this program, you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) first. Run this program using Node and pass in the input file as the first parameter, and the output file as the second. Here's an example:
`node index.js "my code.js" output.js`

This program was inspired by [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ioufuf/when_someone_asks_you_to_write_clear_commented/g4g2dxt) on Reddit. Thanks, u/Pfuenzle and u/Per-mille! Also thanks to u/MajesticThrust for some testing.

I know that the columns that my transpiler generates are not exactly the same as in the original post, but differentiating variable names from class names is an absolute nightmare.

The code is available under an MIT license. Have fun!
